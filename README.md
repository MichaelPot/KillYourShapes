# KillYourShapes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for v 0.25-- luck, critical hit, invisibility, and turret work now. added audio clips for hit reg. added scaling over time, so player and enemy damage and hp scale up over time.

Known bugs: double jump isn't working, enemies spawn in terrain, bullet not registering with void field stuff.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for v 0.2 -- Luck, explosion, and invisibility are not implemented, so do not choose those from the chest.
